/**
 * @file upload_worker.h
 * @brief Dedicated upload worker pool — isolates upload execution from API operators.
 *
 * The problem (proven by fleet-test): the upload pump `poll()`s the calling
 * thread until the transfer finishes, so an upload run inside an API operator
 * blocks every other request on that operator (a slow upload can make /ping time
 * out). This pool runs the FULL upload lifecycle (parse headers → authorize →
 * pump → commit → 201) on its own small set of threads, fed by a dedicated
 * AF_UNIX socket. API operators never touch an upload fd, so a stalled upload
 * changes API latency only slightly and can never stall /ping.
 *
 * The pump code is reused verbatim (client_handle → client_upload_pump); it
 * simply runs on an upload worker instead of an operator. See
 * docs/socket_rearchitecturing.md.
